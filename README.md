# My Personal Project: Home with Aliens

## Overview

A simulation game that you collect cute aliens as pets. As the **FIRST** human living on mars, your lonely self, found a lot of aliens near your cabin. You can enjoy a lot of awesome features like hunting down the aliens. You can look at their information because aliens all have their identification number tattooed under their armpits. (X could be an alien, food, and stories Y could be a collection of aliens and a collection of food, a collection of alienâ€™s stories)

This game is for age 8 and above. I had an idea of this project because I want to make something creative and challenging while still have the opportunity to make it more achievable if my expectation is too *high*. And aliens are very **cool**, I enjoy making up different backgrounds for the characters.
