# My Personal Project: Home with Aliens

## Overview

A simulation game that you collect cute aliens as pets. As the **FIRST** human living on mars, your lonely self, found a lot of aliens near your cabin. You can enjoy a lot of awesome features like hunting down the aliens. You can look at their information because aliens all have their identification number tattooed under their armpits. (X could be an alien, food, and stories Y could be a collection of aliens and a collection of food, a collection of alienâ€™s stories)

This game is for age 8 and above. I had an idea of this project because I want to make something creative and challenging while still have the opportunity to make it more achievable if my expectation is too *high*. And aliens are very **cool**, I enjoy making up different backgrounds for the characters.


## In the context of a an alien management simulation game application:

- As a user, I want to be able to feed my aliens from my petfood inventory.
- As a user, I want to be able to collect my pet aliens and add it to my pet home.
- As a user, I want to be able to observe my pets inside their pet homes. (visibility will be implemented in graphics)
- As a user, I want to be able to browse the information of my pets.
- As a user, I want to be able to interact with my pets. (visibility will be implemented in graphics)
- As a user, I want to be able to *accessorize* my pets. 

- As a user, before I select the quit option from the application menu, I want to be able to save or not save my pet home
- As a user, when I start the game, I want to be given the option to load and resume my last pet home from file or create a new and save to replace my last pet home.
